**Creating Executable Jars**

A `.jar` file can be used to distribute a Java program. A `.jar` file is essentially a `.zip` file that follows a specific structure. This page describes how to use IntelliJ to create a `.jar` file that can be executed from the command line.

# Jar without JavaFX packages (preferred)
This approach requires that the computer on which the `.jar` is to be executed already has JavaFX installed and configured.

## Configuring Jar to be Created
* Go to **File** -> **Project Structure...** (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>)
* Select **Artifacts**
* Click <kbd>+</kbd>
* Select **JAR** -> **From modules with dependencies...**
* Select the class that contains the `main` method (class that extends `Application`)
* Click **OK**
* In the **Output Layout** tab, remove all but the last item:
    + Select **Extracted 'javafx-swf.jar/'** and click <kbd>-</kbd>
    + Remove the remaining entries that begin with **Extracted** leaving just one entry containing **compiled output**

## Creating the Jar
* Go to **Build** -> **Build Artifacts**
* Select the **Build** action in the pop-up menu
* The `.jar` file should be located in a folder in the `out\artifacts` folder of your project

## Running the Jar file
You should be able to run the `.jar` file with the following command (from the command line)

```bash
java --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.swing -jar out\artifacts\WHATEVER_jar\WHATEVER.jar
```

Of course, you'll need to make sure the JavaFX has been installed on the computer and that the `PATH_TO_FX` environment variable has been set appropriately.

# Jar with JavaFX packages included
If the computer intended to run the program does not have JavaFX installed on it, it is possible to bundle the JavaFX libraries in the `.jar` but it requires more steps and results in a larger file.

## Configuring Jar to be Created
* Create the following `Launcher` class
```
public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Replace "Main" with the name of the class that extends Application
        // See https://stackoverflow.com/a/52654791/3956070 for explanation
        Main.main(args); 
    }
}
```
* Go to **File** -> **Project Structure...** (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>)
* Select **Artifacts**
* Click <kbd>+</kbd>
* Select **JAR** -> **From modules with dependencies...**
* Select the class `Launcher` class
* Click **OK**
* Click the <kbd>+</kbd> below the **Output Layout** tab and select **Directory Content**
* Select the `C:\java\javafx-sdk-17.0.1\bin` folder
* Click **OK** twice

## Creating the Jar
* Go to **Build** -> **Build Artifacts**
* Select the **Build** action in the pop-up menu
* The `.jar` file should be located in a folder in the `out\artifacts` folder of your project

## Running the Jar file
You should be able to run the `.jar` file on any Windows system with Java, but not necessarily JavaFX, installed. Use the following command (from the command line):

```bash
java -jar out\artifacts\WHATEVER_jar\WHATEVER.jar
```
