**Creating Executable Jars**

A `.jar` file can be used to distribute a Java program. A `.jar` file is essentially a `.zip` file that follows a specific structure. This page describes how to use IntelliJ to create a `.jar` file that can be executed from the command line.

# Jar without JavaFX packages (prefered)
This approach requires that the computer on which the `.jar` is to be executed already has JavaFX installed and configured.

## Configuring Jar to be Created
* Go to **File** -> **Project Structure...** (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>)
* Select **Artifacts**
* Click <kbd>+</kbd>
* Select **JAR** -> **From modules with dependencies...**
* Select the class that contains the `main` method (class that extends `Application`)
* Click **OK**
* In the **Output Layout** tab, remove all but the last item:
    + Select **Extracted 'javafx-swf.jar/'** and click <kbd>-</kbd>
    + Remove the remaining entries that begin with **Extracted** leaving just one entry containing **compiled output**

## Creating the Jar
* Go to **Build** -> **Build Artifacts**
* Select the **Build** action in the pop-up menu
* The `.jar` file should be located in a folder in the `out\artifacts` folder of your project

## Running the Jar file
You should be able to run the `.jar` file with the following command (from the command line)

```bash
java --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar out\artifacts\WHATEVER_jar\WHATEVER.jar
```

Of course, you'll need to make sure the JavaFX has been installed on the computer and that the `PATH_TO_FX` environment variable has been set appropriately.
