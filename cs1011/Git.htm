**Setting up Git**

     Keeping track of your code and the changes you make can be almost automatic with git.

# Signing up for a Git Repository in the Cloud

There are a number of providers that offer Git repositories that can be
used to back up your repository and easily share your code with others.  Here
are a few options:

* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
* [GitHub](https://education.github.com)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/plans) --  unlimited free private repositories for teams of five

# Download/Install the Git Client

You'll need to download and install the [Git client](http://git-scm.com/downloads).  That's enough to use git within IntelliJ like I do in my lectures, but you may want to download a Git client that offers a GUI.  Here are a few good ones:

* [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com)
* [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
* [GitEye](https://www.collab.net/products/giteyeapp)
